#Description 

This is the first homework project that we have recieved in our coding bootcamp through UC Berkeley. The challenge consisted of refactoring the provided code to make it run in a more efficient manner. 

The provided code was riddled with semantic repetition which was able to be rememedied through the use of different class tags to simplify the overall code. This enabled the search engine optimization to be a much easier task by using universal elements from across all of the major browsers.

#Credits

Below is a resources section comprised of all of the resources that I utilized while completing this assignment. These tools were used for clarity when I was unable to fully comprehend if my refactoring was in fact correct. It was also very helpful in double checking my work with my peers in study groups to confirm my work was compeleted correctly.

* The code was provided through the UC Berkeley Coding bootcamp, in conjunction with edX. 

* Kara Krzystan is a GitHub user who had a video tutorial and a GitHub repository with helpful tips to compelete the homework. The GitHub can be found here. https://github.com/kara-krzystan/horiseon-challenge/blob/master/assets/css/style.css


#Utilized Class Resources 
* The class study groups on slack as well as discord proved to be very helpful tools as well. Both of my classmates who were very helpful while completing this assignment are listed below. 

* Joshua Dempe
* George C Johnson
